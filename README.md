A Terraria Mod. This mod is a mod for players who want to customize their reforges a little more.

This mod adds:
  Basic 'Dormant' Sunstones
	Four types of 'Awoken' Sunstones for all your reforging needs
		Accessory
		Arcane (for Magic and Summoning Weapons)
		Ranged (for Ranged and Thrown Weapons)
		Melee

Currently the 'Dormant' Sunstones have a 1 in 1000 drop chance from any enemy with over 100 max life and can stack to 9999 (more than a sane amount). You can right-click a 'Dormant' Sunstone to get a random 'Awoken' Sunstone. 'Awoken' Sunstones do not stack but their prefix can be put onto any weapon (preferably of the same type).

When you right-click an 'Awoken' Sunstone in your inventory, the prefix will be applied to the current held weapon and use up the Sunstone.

This mod also features a purple reforge color when reforging Sunstones to stick out and make spotting those Legendary  prefixes easier (I didnt forget Unreal, Mythical, and the optimal Accessory prefixes).

Drop rate can be adjusted in the config by changing the value to any positive whole number or 0.
The droprate is calculated by using the odds of one in "X" chance of dropping a Sunstone- if set to 0 then they will never drop.
