This mod is a mod for players who want to customize your reforges a little more.

This mod adds:
- 'Dormant' Sunstones
- Four types of 'Awoken' Sunstones for all your reforging needs
  - Accessory
  - Arcane (for Magic and Summoning Weapons)
  - Ranged (for Ranged and Thrown Weapons)
  - Melee


Currently the 'Dormant' Sunstones have a 1 in 200 drop chance from any enemy and can stack to 9999 (more than a sane amount). You can right-click a 'Dormant' Sunstone to get a random 'Awoken' Sunstone.

'Awoken' Sunstones do not stack but their prefix can be put onto any weapon (preferably of the same type).

When you right-click an 'Awoken' Sunstone in your inventory, the prefix will be applied to the current held weapon and use up the Sunstone.


This mod also features a purple reforge color when reforging Sunstones to stick out and make spotting those Legendary prefixes easier.
